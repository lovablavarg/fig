n1 is just n2p
n1 is just like n2p #Just pay attention.
Try to be n2 #(n1)
Try to be like n2 #(n1)
The only thing you should concern yourself with is to make n1 into n2p
I v1 you. #I v2 you. #I v3 you.
I v1 myself. #I v2 myself. #I v3 myself.
You v1 me. #I v2 you. #And so it goes.
Remember to v1 n1p
Don’t v1 n1p
Always v1 n1p
We carefully construct n1 around ourselves.
I was only in love with n1p
You're still in love with n1p
Rid yourself of n1 and be free for once.
Never forget: n1 is also n2p
One cannot love n1 as one loves n2p
The relation between n1 and n2 is never settled.
n1 is red. #n2 is red. #n3 is red. #But n4 is the deepest blue.
A recipe for n1p #1. Start with n2p #2. Add n3p #3. Mix thoroughly.
n1 can be divided into three components: #1. n2p #2. n3p #3. n4p
n1 is n2p That is its glory.
n1p #That is always the point.
n1 is like n2p #Only louder.
If you want to v1 yourself, #you have to v2 yourself.
I don’t just v1 myself. #I v2 myself.
(Talking about n1) #Don’t limit yourself to n2p
n1p #That’s what I speak about when I speak about n2p
Surround yourself with n1 and n2 and n3p #Because those are the only things they can never take away from you.
I remind myself: #v1 n1p
v1 n1p #But do it for the right reasons.
Once we v1 n1p #It is already too late.
[…] to v1 myself. #Perpetually.
n1 is always bad. #n2 is always good.
n1 is poisonous.
n1p #n2p #First one and then the other.
n1 can serve one better than n2p
No need to v1 yourself. #No need to v2 yourself. #All you have to do is v3 yourself.
Could you please v1 me and v2 me. Tenderly.
I yield to n1p
n1 is n2 #n2 is n1
You cannot protect yourself from n1 without protecting yourself from n2p
First of all, #n1 is n2p #Second of all, #n3 is n4p
Dedicate your artwork to n1p
Sometimes, #n1 becomes part of who you are.
We v1 n1 in order to live.
Nothing’s worse than n1p
You don’t v1 her. #You v2 her.
We v1 n1 not to v2 n2 but to v3 n3p
n1 becomes n2p
n1 is my mother.
v1 n1p #Or die.
If all you do is v1 n1 that is more than enough.
You should always pick n1 over n2p
And here comes n1 again. #Rejoice and be happy!
The soul is made of n1 and n2 commingled.
I v1 n1p #Luminous.
Opt for n1 and n2 whenever it is practical and convenient.
Dare to v1 and dare to v2
May n1 be forever your guide.
The difference between men and women is the difference between n1 and n2p
Men have n1p #Women have n2p
To v1 n1 is not to v2 n2p
Consider n1p #Consider it again.
One can only love n1 with the help of n2p
n1 was split by n2 into n3 and n4p
Demolish the distinction between n1 and n2p
I v1 n1 perhaps because I cannot v1 n2p
n1p #n2p #n3p #(But not necessarily in that order)
In a certain sense n1 is far more real than n2p
And n1 like n2 can be soft; it, too, is n3p
n1 is a waste of time, #v1 n2p
I will v1 #I will v2 #I will v3 #but only in order to get closer to you.
You are continually accompanied by n1 and n2p
I want my life to be n1p #Or n2p
To be a true artist you must v1 n1p
All I want is to v1 n1p #Is that too much to ask?
Drown yourself in n1p #Anything else is folly.
