                    This website generates random lines of poetry or maxims.
                    <br><br>The project aims to explore the middle-ground between authorship and automatisation since all the possible phrase
                    components have been carefully selected and authored by the artist, but the combination is randomized by a
                    computer. Each phrase can, therefore, be seen as co-authored by the artist and the computer. The work aims to pose the
                    question of how we read literature generated by a computer. Can we read it in the same way as we read literature
                    authored by humans? Is it even literature without authorial intent? It is easy, as a reader, to dismiss work
                    generated by a computer as inferior or nonsensical, while we read human seemingly nonsensical poetry with careful
                    attention. How much credit for the generated phrase should be given to the author, and how much should be given
                    to the computer?
